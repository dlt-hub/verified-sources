This repository contains verified dlt sources and demo pipelines for each source that you can use as a starting point for your project.

## How to add a verified source to your dlt project
`dlt` offers an `init` command that will clone and inject any source with an example pipeline from this repository into your project, setup the credentials and python dependencies. Please follow the step by step instructions in our [docs](https://dlthub.com/docs/walkthroughs/add-a-verified-source).

### We encourage you to hack the code
Verified sources code is added to your project with the expectation that you will hack or customize code yourself - as you need it.
