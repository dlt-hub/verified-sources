# What is a community pipeline
A "community pipeline" is a track to quickly share a working pipeline for a particular data source. Such pipeline will be distributed with `dlt init` in `community pipelines` section. Before accepting for distribution we'll review your code and make sure it is passing all required checks.

Please tell us about your pipeline below, then open a PR and link this issue in it.

# Quick pipeline info
- Name of the pipeline: [e.g. stripe]
- What is the data source: [e.g. link to API spec, home page etc.]
- I tried following destinations with it: [e.g. duckdb, bigquery]

# Why it got built?
- [ ] I run it for fun
- [ ] I run it on my local laptop
- [ ] I run it in production

# How much of your involvement can we expect?
We want to optimize the time you spent on this contribution. To successfully merge the PR we may require some fixes in the submitted code:
- [ ] I'm ok with implementing the code review fixes

Things below are 100% optional but are helping us to make your pipeline a `verified` one - with tests and running in our CI
