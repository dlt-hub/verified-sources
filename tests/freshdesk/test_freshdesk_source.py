#     Tests loading data from all Freshdesk default endpoints to a specified

#     This test creates a DLT pipeline configured for a full refresh load, runs
#     the pipeline to load data from all Freshdesk endpoints, and then verifies
#     that the load was successful and the data counts in the destination match
#     expected values. It also tests the pipeline's ability to handle incremental
#     loads correctly by re-running the pipeline and ensuring data counts remain
#     unchanged.
