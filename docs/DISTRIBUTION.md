# How the verified sources are distributed to our users

We are trying a distribution model that allows our user to easily customize and hack the source code. So our sources are not distributed as black boxes (ie. `pip` packages) but clones into user's project from this very repo.

This may look a little bit weird from software engineering perspective but we want to try it. Going back to `pip` package model is quite easy and we may do it on top or instead of the model below.

## Use `dlt init` to add a source and its demo pipeline to your project

We'll use the [dlt init](https://dlthub.com/docs/walkthroughs/add-a-pipeline) command to distribute the source.


1. Sources are distributed by `dlt init` command that can be issued several times.
2. Sources come from `[sources](sources) folder of this repo and if thereâ€™s no source with the requested name there, the [init](init) folder is used.
3. The sources are added to the current project as source code: the folder (ie. `pipedrive`) and the example script (`pipedrive_pipeline.py`) are added to the project.
4. The freelancer/end user is able to copy and paste and hack the code of the source.
5. The subsequent `dlt init` with existing source will update the code. User hacks and modifications will be preserved (if user chooses so).
6. Versioning: using `git` for distribution provides enough versioning information. (tags, branches, commit ids)

For example if someone issues `dlt init chess bigquery`:

1. `dlt` clones the repo and finds the `chess` in `sources` folder.
2. it copies the `chess` folder and `chess_pipeline.py` to user's project folder
3. it modifies the example script `chess_pipeline.py` to use `bigquery` to load data
4. it inspects the `dlt.resource` and `dlt.source` functions in `chess` module and generates config/credentials sections


## From verified source project to customer / end user
We want our end users to hack the verified sources and pipelines too! So still no black boxes

1. The implementer should customize and hack the sources from `dlt init` as they wish
2. The implementer should generate deployment with `dlt deploy`
3. The distribution to customer happens as source code via git repository.
4. The customer is able to hack and customize the source.
