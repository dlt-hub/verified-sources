# Notion

Notion is a tool that allows users to organize and manage their personal and professional lives. Using this Notion `dlt` verified source and pipeline example, you can load the databases from Notion to a [destination](https://dlthub.com/docs/dlt-ecosystem/destinations/) of your choice. You can load the following source using this pipeline example:

| Source | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Notion_databases | feature that allows you to create structured collections of information. They are similar to spreadsheets or tables but with added flexibility and functionality. |

## Setup verified source and pipeline example

To grab the Notion credentials, and initialize the pipeline, please refer to the [full documentation here.](https://dlthub.com/docs/dlt-ecosystem/verified-sources/notion)

## Initialize the verified source and pipeline example
```bash
dlt init notion bigquery
```

Here, we chose BigQuery as the destination. Alternatively, you can also choose redshift, duckdb, or any of the otherÂ [destinations.](https://dlthub.com/docs/dlt-ecosystem/destinations/)

## **Add credentials**

1. Open `.dlt/secrets.toml`.
2. Enter the API key:
    ```toml
    # Put your secret values and credentials here
    # Note: Do not share this file and do not push it to GitHub!
    [source.notion]
    api_key = "set me up!" # Notion API token (e.g. secret_XXX...)
    ```
3. Enter credentials for your chosen destination as per the [docs](https://dlthub.com/docs/dlt-ecosystem/destinations/).

## Run the pipeline example
1. Install the necessary dependencies by running the following command:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    
2. Now the pipeline can be run by using the command:
    ```bash
    python3 notion_pipeline.py
    ```
    
3. To make sure that everything is loaded as expected, use the command:
    ```bash
    dlt pipeline <pipeline_name> show
    ```
    
    For example, the pipeline_name for the above pipeline example is `notion`, you may also use any custom name instead.

It provides comprehensive information and guidance on how to further customize and tailor the pipeline to suit your specific needs.
