# Google Sheets

This verified source can be used to load data from a [Google Sheets](https://www.google.com/sheets/about/) workspace onto a destination of your choice.

| Endpoints | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Tables | tables of the spreadsheet, tables have same name as individual sheets |
| Named ranges | loaded as a separate column with an automatically generated header |
| Merged cells | retains only the cell value that was taken during the merge (e.g., top-leftmost), and every other cell in the merge is given a null value |


Initialize a¬†`dlt`¬†project with the following command:
```bash
dlt init google_sheets bigquery
```

Here, we chose BigQuery as the destination. To choose a different destination, replace¬†`bigquery`¬†with your choice of [destination.](https://dlthub.com/docs/dlt-ecosystem/destinations)
