# Hubspot

HubSpot is a customer relationship management (CRM) software and inbound marketing platform that helps businesses attract visitors, engage customers, and close leads.

The `dlt` HubSpot verified source allows you to automatically load data from HubSpot into a [destination](https://dlthub.com/docs/dlt-ecosystem/destinations/) of your choice. It loads data to the following resources:

| resource                   | data                                                                     |
