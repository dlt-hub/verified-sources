# Hubspot

HubSpot is a customer relationship management (CRM) software and inbound marketing platform that helps businesses attract visitors, engage customers, and close leads.

The `dlt` HubSpot verified source allows you to automatically load data from HubSpot into a [destination](https://dlthub.com/docs/dlt-ecosystem/destinations/) of your choice. It loads data from the following endpoints:

| API | Data |
| --- | --- |
| Contacts | visitors, potential customers, leads |
| Companies | information about organizations |
| Deals | deal records, deal tracking |
| Products | goods, services |
| Tickets | requests for help from customers or users |
| Quotes | pricing information of a product |
| Web analytics | events |

## Initialize the pipeline with Hubspot verified source
```bash
dlt init hubspot duckdb
```

Here, we chose DuckDB as the destination. Alternatively, you can also choose redshift, bigquery, or any of the other [destinations.](https://dlthub.com/docs/dlt-ecosystem/destinations/)
